		<main><p>This Asian Chicken Chopped Salad gets its cred from our tangy Asian Sesame Vinaigrette and hoisin sauce dressing.  Toss with grilled chicken and veggies for a bowl of crisp deliciousness.It’s time for another Asian inspired salad.And this one, I gotta say, is going to be one that’s going to stick around for a while. I’ve already penciled in this recipe for dinner at least once a week. <– You guys know about my food binges. I get on a never-stopping roller coaster of a particular food and don’t get off until I’ve enjoyed the same thing at least a bazillion times. Brace yourselves; I may never end up getting off this one.</p>
		<p>Color. Crunch. Texture. Savory. Sweet. Salty. Heat. Gah! This salad has it goin’ on!</p>
		<p>It’s a goodness overload with this Asian sesame chicken salad. The crisp romaine lettuce is all chopped up and is the perfect base for what’s to come on top! Lots of mandarin oranges, grilled chicken, a little freshy freshness from my most favorite herb of all time, cilantro, and a sweet and tangy Asian sesame vinaigrette that will have you CRAVING it all day long. And IF you don’t make some for yourself, you may even start dreaming about it. It’s some powerful stuff. But wait. a. minute. I haven’t even told you that I topped this salad with a handful of crispy golden brown wonton strips PLUS (wait for it…) toasted sliced almonds.</p></main>

		<main><p>Bruschetta is an antipasto (starter dish) from Italy consisting of grilled bread rubbed with garlic and topped with olive oil and salt. Variations may include toppings of tomato, vegetables, beans, cured meat, or cheese. A popular dish is bruschetta with tomatoes; one recipe popular outside Italy involves basil, fresh tomato, garlic and onion or mozzarella. Bruschetta is usually served as a snack or appetizer. In some countries, the prepared topping is marketed as bruschetta.</p>
		<p>In Italy, bruschetta is often prepared using a brustolina grill. In the Abruzzo region of Italy a variation of bruschetta made with a salame called ventricina is served. Raw pork products and spices encased in pig bladder are aged and the paste spread on open slices of bread which are sometimes grilled.[4] The dish was developed as a way of salvaging bread that was going stale.[5] In Tuscany it is called fettunta and it is usually served without toppings, especially in November, to taste the first oil of the season.</p></main>

		<header><i class="fas fa-utensils fa-5x"></i><h2>Chinese style - Orange chicken</h2></header>
		<main><p>The variety of orange chicken most commonly found at North American Chinese restaurants consists of chopped, battered and fried chicken pieces coated in a sweet orange-flavored chili sauce, which thickens or caramelizes to a glaze. While the dish is very popular in the United States, it is most often found as a variation of General Tso's chicken in North America rather than the dish found in mainland China. Chef Andy Kao claims to have developed the original Chinese-American orange chicken recipe at a Panda Express in Hawaii in 1987.Since Panda Express is closely associated with this dish, Panda Express uses orange chicken as a promotion tool by having a dedicated food truck tour the country distributing samples of orange chicken.</p>
		<p>Orange chicken is called Chinese food in North America, but orange chicken is rarely found in Chinese restaurants in China. Andrew Cherng, owner and founder of Panda Express, said that orange chicken is just a variation of General Tso's chicken, another dish that is almost unknown in China. Journalist Jennifer 8. Lee says that both "General Tso's chicken and Orange Chicken are Americanized mutations of sweet and sour dishes found in China." Orange chicken has also entered the menus of the mainstream U.S. by being served in school cafeterias,and in military bases' chow halls, and also found in the supermarket frozen meal aisle.</p></main>

		<header><i class="fas fa-stroopwafel fa-5x"></i><h2>Continental style - Paneer steak</h2></header>
		<main><p>There are two main seasons when you can enjoy hot snacks and appetizers along with the climate…. Monsoon and Winters. There are couple of months left for the winters to arrive but Monsoon has certainly arrived at our door step and giving enough opportunities to us to enjoy savories and mouth watering appetizers. One such all time favorite monsoon appetizer at my home is Grilled Paneer Skewers or Steaks. I have a potable BBQ at home, but sometimes just find myself too lazy to get that working. But nothing worries me till i find any substitute for that, and here in this case the substitute for my BBQ is my very humble stove top.</p>
		<p>Yes, you heard me right, today i shall be sharing the recipe of Paneer Steaks made on stove top.So when it comes to grilling, it has to be a grill pan. The grill pan is something i love to use in my kitchen for some of my particular recipes like chicken and fish. The pattern that prints on the body of the food is not just beautiful but also invites and makes the food very appealing. So here in this recipe i did not use any onion or tomato. Its a much more healthier version than what i regularly make. It has vegetables like broccoli, red and yellow bell peppers and paneer of course. I substituted mustard oil with olive oil to make it more healthier. Let’s check out the recipe …</p></main>
